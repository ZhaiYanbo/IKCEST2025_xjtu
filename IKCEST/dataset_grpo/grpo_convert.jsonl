The angle $\\angle ABC$ is given as $70^\\circ$. We are asked to find the measure of the central angle $\\angle AOC$.\nThe angle $\\angle ABC$ is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc AC. The angle $\\angle AOC$ is the central angle that subtends the same arc AC.\nAccording to the theorem relating the central angle and the inscribed angle subtending the same arc, the measure of the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle.\nTherefore, we have the relationship:\n$\\angle AOC = 2 \\times \\angle ABC$\nGiven that $\\angle ABC = 70^\\circ$.\nSubstituting this value into the equation, we get:\n$\\angle AOC = 2 \\times 70^\\circ$\n$\\angle AOC = 140^\\circ$\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\nA: $140^\\circ$\nB: $130^\\circ$\nC: $120^\\circ$\nD: $110^\\circ$\nOur calculated value of $140^\\circ$ matches option A.\n\nTherefore, the degree of angle AOC is $140^\\circ$.\n\nThe question is a multiple choice question. The answer is the letter corresponding to the correct option.\nThe correct option is A.\n\nFinal check of the question and requirements.\nQuestion: As shown in the figure, triangle ABC is the inscribed triangle of circle O. then the degree of angle AOC is equal to ()\nChoices: A:140° B:130° C:120° D:110°\nFormat: <think>...</think> <answer>...", "image": "images_grpo/mathverse_364.png", "type": "multi-choice"}
